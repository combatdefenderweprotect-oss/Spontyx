# Spontix Tier Architecture

Last updated: 2026-04-24

This document is the authoritative reference for all tier logic in Spontix. All pricing, feature gates, limits, and upgrade copy must be derived from this file. The implementation lives in `TIER_LIMITS` in `spontix-store.js`.

---

## Core Monetization Rule

Spontix question lanes are monetized in strict order:

| Lane | Tier access | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `CORE_MATCH_PREMATCH` | Starter, Pro, Elite | Entry-level value — taste of the product |
| `CORE_MATCH_LIVE` | **Pro, Elite only** | Core product differentiator — the upgrade hook |
| `REAL_WORLD` | Pro (limited), Elite (full) | Premium intelligence layer — high cost, high perceived value |

**Real World questions cost money to generate (OpenAI + API-Sports calls) and must never be treated as free default content.**

The upgrade hook for Starter → Pro is always "Unlock Live Match Predictions". Every locked-feature prompt should reinforce this.

---

## Player Tiers

| Create leagues / week | 1 |
| Join leagues | 3 |
| Max players in own league | 10 |
| AI questions / month | 30 |

## Venue Tiers

### Venue Starter — Free

Purpose: let venues test Spontix at a single event with no commitment.

| Feature | Value |
|---|---|
| Price | Free |
| Events / month | 2 |
| Max participants / event | 25 |
| AI questions / month | 0 (pre-made bank only) |
| **CORE_MATCH_LIVE AI** | 🔒 locked |
| **REAL_WORLD** | 🔒 locked |
| Real World questions / month | 0 |
| Custom branding | 🔒 locked |
| Custom photos | 🔒 locked |
| Custom trophies | 🔒 locked |
| Can award trophies | No |
| Analytics | 🔒 locked |
| TV display mode | 🔒 locked |
| Floor map | 🔒 locked |
| Multi-venue | 🔒 locked |

**Why no AI on free:** each AI-enabled event costs ~$0.15–0.30 in generation + API resolver calls. Cannot absorb at scale. Pre-made question bank gives the UX without the cost.

---

### Venue Pro — €29.99 / month

Purpose: regular sports bars running recurring events who want AI to handle question generation.

**Upgrade copy:** *"Let AI run your match night"*

## Implementation Notes

### Central source of truth

`TIER_LIMITS` in `spontix-store.js` is the single source of truth for all tier logic. **Do not hardcode tier values anywhere else.** Always read from `SpontixStore.getTierLimits(tier)`.

### Tier resolution

```js
const player = SpontixStore.getPlayer();
const tier   = player?.tier || 'starter';
const limits = SpontixStore.getTierLimits(tier);
```

For venues:
```js
const tier   = localStorage.getItem('spontix_user_tier') || 'venue-starter';
const limits = SpontixStore.getTierLimits(tier);
```

### Three enforcement layers (all three must apply)

1. **UI** — controls are visually locked with a tier badge. User sees what they're missing.
2. **Handler** — click handlers call `SpontixSidebar.showUpgradeModal()` instead of executing.
3. **Store** — functions return `{ error: 'tier' }` when called on an ineligible tier.

### `liveQuestionsEnabled` — the primary gate key

This boolean is the canonical check for whether a user can access `CORE_MATCH_LIVE` questions. Always check this key rather than comparing tier strings or tier rank numbers.

```js
// Correct
if (!limits.liveQuestionsEnabled) { /* show upgrade modal */ }

// Wrong — hardcoded tier comparison, brittle
if (tier === 'starter') { /* show upgrade modal */ }
```

### `realWorldQuestionsEnabled` — three states

- `false` — fully locked (Starter)
- `'limited'` — quota-capped (Pro: 10/month player, 20/month venue)
- `true` — full access (Elite)

### Elite tier forcing (MVP)

`authGate()` in `spontix-store.js` currently forces `elite` / `venue-elite` for all users until Stripe billing is wired. When Stripe lands, remove the forced tier assignment and read the real tier from the `users` table.

---

## Enforcement Status

### Currently enforced (frontend UI + handler)
- Live questions locked in `create-league.html` (question mode selector) via `liveQuestionsEnabled`
- Custom photo upload locked in `profile.html` (Upload Photo tab) via `customPhotoUpload`
- Season-long league locked in `create-league.html` (Step 0 type selector — "Elite" badge)
- Upgrade modal pricing uses correct €7.99 / €19.99 / €29.99 / €79.99 values

### Currently enforced (frontend handler — localStorage-tracked)
- `liveQuestionsPerMatch` — Starter limited to 3 live answer submissions per match in `league.html` `handleAnswer()`. Key: `spontix_live_count_{userId}_{matchRef}`.
- `aiPreviewPerEvent` — Venue Starter limited to 3 AI question pushes per event in `venue-live-floor.html` `pushNextQuestion()`.

### Currently enforced (Edge Function — server-side)
- `realWorldQuestionsPerMonth` — enforced in `generate-questions` Edge Function via `checkRealWorldQuota()` in `lib/quota-checker.ts`. Starter: fully blocked (`real_world_tier_locked`). Pro: 10/month per league (`real_world_quota_reached` when limit hit). Elite: unlimited. Quota is checked against `questions` table monthly count. Owner tier resolved from `users.tier` via `owner_id` on `leagues`.

### UI-only — backend RLS enforcement needed post-launch
- `leaguesCreatePerWeek` — checked in handler but not enforced at DB level
- `leaguesJoinMax` — checked in handler but not enforced at DB level
- `leagueMaxPlayers` — checked in handler but not enforced at DB level
- `aiQuestionsPerMonth` — generation pipeline uses quota from `leagues.ai_weekly_quota` (set at creation), not from live tier check
- `battleRoyalePerDay` / `triviaGamesPerDay` — checked in handler only

### Not yet wired (post-launch)
- Stripe billing → real tier reads from `users.tier`
- RLS policies mirroring tier limits for league creation and membership
- Venue event count enforcement at DB level

## Future Upgrade Paths

- **Streak shield** — optional Elite feature: protects streak on one wrong answer per match
- **Private leagues** — Elite: leagues not discoverable in public search
- **Priority Real World generation** — Elite leagues get first slot in each generation cycle
- **Venue sponsored questions** — Venue Elite: venue sells branded question slots to drink brands etc.
- **Venue API access** — Venue Elite: embed Spontyx question feed in venue's own app or screen system
